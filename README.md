# eDNA qPCR assay and project validation tool 

(TODO) ADD LICENCE

(TODO) DISCLAIMER ON INTERPRETATION - IMPORTANT

The primary purpose of this tool is to aid in the interpretation of quantitative PCR (qPCR) results from environmental DNA (eDNA) samples. The tool is also used to assign a confidence level (Low, Medium, High) to a qPCR assay based on a simple checklist of the assay validation steps that have been so far undertaken. Broadly, the confidence levels can be viewed as follows:

Low: interpret both positive and negative results with caution. There can be false positives (a positive signal may have arisen from a non-target species). There can be false negatives (an absence of detection does not indicate that the species is absent from the sampling point).
Medium: positive samples can interpreted as "Species DNA present in sample". There can be false negatives.
